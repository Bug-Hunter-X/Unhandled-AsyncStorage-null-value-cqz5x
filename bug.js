This error occurs when using AsyncStorage in React Native and trying to retrieve data that doesn't exist.  It's easily missed because AsyncStorage doesn't throw an explicit error when the key is not found; instead, it returns `null`. If your code doesn't handle the `null` case correctly, it might lead to unexpected behavior or crashes further down the line.

```javascript
// buggy code
const value = await AsyncStorage.getItem('myKey');
console.log(JSON.parse(value)); // Crashes if value is null
```
